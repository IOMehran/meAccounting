# meAccounting Personal Accounting App
meAccounting is a personal accounting app that simply helps you to submit and track your expenses and incomes.

* currently, the App is unstable and highly under development. so feel free to contribute. your PRs gonna make me happy :)

and oh! I know App's UI may be bad! that's because I'm not front-end guy! so if you can make it beautiful, It'll be great!

There are some screenshot from App's UI above:
